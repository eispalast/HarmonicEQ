# Harmonic EQ VST3 Audio effect
A multiband parametric equalizer, that can automatically affect up to 5 harmonics of the base frequency.

You need to download the official VST3 SDK from steinberg to build this project.

## current state
It works!
But the GUI is far from being finished and the code needs lots of refactoring.
